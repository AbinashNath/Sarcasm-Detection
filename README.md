# Sarcasm-Detection
## A Final Year Project Under the supervision of Dr. Ujwala Baruah
## Identification of Sarcasm in Textual Data


Sarcasm detection is a subtask of opinion mining. Our objective is to develop a predictive model that labels Tweets(Twitter) or Newspaper headlines as sarcastic or not sarcastic. Our primary goal is to detect sarcasm detection in textual data. Sarcasm is a form of verbal irony with a slightly greater positive sense that is intended to express contempt or ridicule.
For example, 'You just broke my car window, Great Job!' is a sarcastic sentence because the surface sentiment of the word 'Great' (positive) is different from implied sentiment (negative) of the sentence,considering the remaining portion of the text.
Various methods such as SVM, LDA, Random Forest and KNN are applied in this context. We aim to study some algorithms from these and contribute to future sarcasm detection work.
